# Virtual Pet Shelter
This is a virtual pet shelter game in which you can choose to care for the pets, adopt a pet, or admit a pet. Upon starting the game, you will be asked to choose a number
1 through 6 in order to carry out any of these functions. However, every interaction increases the pets' hunger, boredom, and thirst. If any of these attributes reach 
level 100, you will lose the game.
